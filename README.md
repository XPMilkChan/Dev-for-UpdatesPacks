for MSU Hotfix https://www.sereby.org/site/hfext
The "Hotfix Extr4ct0r" is an AutoIt script I wrote.
This script allows to unpack all kinds of hotfixes.

The following file types are supported:

     .EXE (Win 2000 - 2003)
     .MSU (Vista)
     .CAB
     .MSP (Framework, Office, etc.)

The "Hotfix Extr4ct0r" also allows multiple hotfixes to be extracted at the same time.
To extract, the selected updates simply have to be dragged onto the "Hotfix Extr4ct0r" (drag & drop).
